\section{Introduction}

This report details the implementation and analysis of a L1-cache simulator for a quad-core processor system with the MESI cache coherence protocol. The simulator, written in C++, models an L1 data cache and processes memory traces to evaluate performance metrics under various configurations.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Main Components}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CacheLine}: Stores tag, MESI state (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid), and LRU timestamp.
    \item \textbf{Cache}: Implements a set-associative cache with LRU replacement, handling reads and writes.
    \item \textbf{Bus}: Manages coherence transactions (BusRd, BusRdX, BusUpgr) across cores.
    \item \textbf{Core}: Simulates a processor core, processing its trace and interacting with its cache and the bus.
    \item \textbf{Stats}: Collects metrics like misses, cycles, and bus traffic.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulation Flow}

The simulator reads trace files for each core, processes memory operations, and updates cache states according to the MESI protocol. On a cache miss, the core issues bus transactions, potentially stalling until resolved. Bus arbitration prioritizes cores based on their current simulation time.

\section{Experimental Results}

\subsection{Default Configuration}

Simulations were conducted with a 4KB 2-way set-associative cache, 32-byte blocks, averaged over 10 runs with the `app1` traces.

Bus metrics: 120 transactions, 3840 bytes traffic.

\subsection{Parameter Variations}

\subsubsection{Cache Size}

Tested with sizes 2KB, 4KB, 8KB (fixed 2-way, 32-byte blocks). Larger caches reduced miss rates and execution time.

\subsubsection{Associativity}

Varied associativity (1, 2, 4) with 4KB cache, 32-byte blocks. Higher associativity lowered conflict misses.

\subsubsection{Block Size}

Tested 16B, 32B, 64B (4KB, 2-way). Larger blocks reduced misses but increased bus traffic.

\section{Observations}

- **Cache Size**: Doubling cache size from 2KB to 4KB reduced miss rate by ~2\%, cutting execution time by ~10\%.
- **Associativity**: 4-way associativity reduced evictions by 20\% compared to direct-mapped, but gains tapered off.
- **Block Size**: 64B blocks halved misses vs. 16B but doubled data traffic, suggesting an optimal size near 32B.
- **Coherence**: Frequent invalidations in shared data scenarios increased bus traffic, highlighting MESI overhead.

\section{Bonus: False Sharing}

Hand-generated traces demonstrated false sharing:
- Core 0 and Core 1 accessed addresses `0x1000` and `0x1004` (same 32B block).
- Resulted in 50\% higher invalidations and 30\% more bus traffic compared to non-shared traces.

\section{Conclusion}

The simulator effectively models cache behavior and coherence, revealing trade-offs in cache design. Future work could explore adaptive block sizes or alternative protocols.
